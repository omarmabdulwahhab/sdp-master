# Project Documentation

## Overview

This project provides a structured system for managing donations, library services, and events. Built using a layered architecture, it organizes core functionalities across packages including `Controller`, `MODEL`, `DBUtil`, `DTO`, and `View`. Testing is implemented using JUnit, and the database is connected via MySQL.

## Project Structure

### Root Files

- **README.md**: This documentation file, providing an overview of the project.
- **build.xml**: Apache Ant build script, automating build and deployment processes.
- **manifest.mf**: Defines manifest attributes for creating a JAR file.

### Libraries

- **libs**: Contains external dependencies:
  - `junit-4.13.2-javadoc.jar`: Documentation for the JUnit framework used for unit testing.
  - `mysql-connector-j-8.3.0.jar`: MySQL Connector library for handling database connections.

### Project Configuration

- **nbproject**: NetBeans configuration files, including:
  - `build-impl.xml`: Internal build configuration file.
  - `project.properties`: Project-specific properties.
  - `project.xml`: General project metadata.

### Source and Output Code

- **src**: Contains the main source code organized by modules:
  - `Controller`: Manages donation and library services logic.
  - `MODEL`: Implements the Data Access Object (DAO) pattern, with sub-packages for:
    - `DAO`: Data access layer classes, handling database CRUD operations.
    - `Patterns`: Implements common design patterns:
      - `decorator`: Classes for enhancing donations with specific features.
      - `factory`: Factory classes for event creation.
      - `singleton`: Singleton pattern for database connections.
  - `DBUtil`: Contains utilities for managing database connectivity.
  - `DTO`: Data Transfer Objects that represent data structures within the project.
  - `View`: Handles the project’s view-related classes, like command-line displays.
  - `constatns`: Configuration files, e.g., `constants.properties`.

- **out**: Contains the compiled classes, matching the `src` structure for easy navigation.

- **test**: Directory for unit tests, including:
  - `generalTest`: General tests for main classes.
  - `patterns`: Tests for implemented design patterns.

## Prerequisites

- **Java**: JDK 8 or higher.
- **MySQL**: Database server for data persistence.
- **Apache Ant**: For running the build script.
- **JUnit**: Included in `libs` for running unit tests.

## Database Design

The database design for this project is maintained and visualized on **DB Schema**. For a full database schema and to modify relationships, refer to [our schema on dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/d/test-671eed8497a66db9a37220e7).

### Important Notes on Database Management

- Use the latest `SQL` file uploaded to the **main branch** of the project repository for the most up-to-date schema.
- Do not use automatically generated SQL exports from dbdiagram.io; always refer to the SQL file on the main branch to avoid inconsistencies.
- Ensure that any modifications to the database structure are saved and updated on the main branch.

## Class Diagram

The class diagram provides an overview of the project's structure, showcasing relationships between key classes and their interactions. It visualizes the organization of main components like the Controller, MODEL, DTO, and View, as well as pattern implementations including the decorator, factory, and singleton patterns.

## Setting Up

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure the MySQL Connector (e.g., `mysql-connector-j-8.3.0.jar`) is available in the `libs` directory.
3. Update `constants.properties` in `src/constatns` with the database configuration:
   ```properties
   jdbc.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3307/sdp_database
   jdbc.username=YOUR_USERNAME
   jdbc.password=YOUR_PASSWORD
